# Cisco IE1000 by SNMP

## Overview

This template monitors Cisco Industrial Ethernet 1000 Series switches through
SNMP. It uses Cisco IE1000 private MIB objects for platform, temperature, power,
status, and PoE data, and IF-MIB objects for interface discovery and traffic.

The template was exported from and prepared for Zabbix 7.0.

## Requirements

- Zabbix 7.0 or later
- An SNMP interface configured on the monitored host
- SNMP access to the Cisco IE1000 switch

No external scripts are required.

## Tested versions

| Component | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Zabbix | 7.0.26 |
| Switch | Cisco IE-1000-4P2S-LM |
| IE1000 software | saturn-3.05.03 / 1.8.2 |

Standard ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB and CISCO-ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB were not available on
the tested switch. The temperature items therefore use CIE1000-SYSUTIL-MIB.

## Installation

1. Import `template_cisco_ie1000_by_snmp.yaml` in **Data collection >
   Templates**.
2. Create or select the Cisco IE1000 host and configure its SNMP interface.
3. Link the `Cisco IE1000 by SNMP` template to the host.
4. Adjust interface discovery macros if required.

## Monitored data

- Board inventory and serial numbers
- CPU load
- Board and junction temperatures, thresholds, and alarm states
- Main and redundant power supply states
- System, alarm, PoE, and power status text
- PoE switch budget and per-port state, power, current, and PD class
- Interface status, type, speed, traffic, errors, and discards

The template contains 28 direct items, two low-level discovery rules, 15 item
prototypes, seven direct triggers, two trigger prototypes, and five value maps.

PoE PD class can return `-1` when no usable class or powered device is detected.
The item prototype uses Numeric (float) so that this valid device response is
stored instead of becoming unsupported.

## Discovery macros

| Macro | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{$IFCONTROL}` | `1` | Enables link-down trigger prototypes |
| `{$NET.IF.IFADMINSTATUS.MATCHES}` | `^.*` | Includes matching administrative states |
| `{$NET.IF.IFADMINSTATUS.NOT_MATCHES}` | `^2$` | Excludes administratively down interfaces |
| `{$NET.IF.IFALIAS.MATCHES}` | `.*` | Includes matching interface aliases |
| `{$NET.IF.IFALIAS.NOT_MATCHES}` | `CHANGE_IF_NEEDED` | Excludes matching interface aliases |
| `{$NET.IF.IFDESCR.MATCHES}` | `.*` | Includes matching interface descriptions |
| `{$NET.IF.IFDESCR.NOT_MATCHES}` | `CHANGE_IF_NEEDED` | Excludes matching interface descriptions |
| `{$NET.IF.IFNAME.MATCHES}` | `^.*$` | Includes matching interface names |
| `{$NET.IF.IFNAME.NOT_MATCHES}` | See template | Excludes loopback, null, virtual, and container interfaces |
| `{$NET.IF.IFOPERSTATUS.MATCHES}` | `^.*$` | Includes matching operational states |
| `{$NET.IF.IFOPERSTATUS.NOT_MATCHES}` | `^6$` | Excludes interfaces in `notPresent` state |
| `{$NET.IF.IFTYPE.MATCHES}` | `.*` | Includes matching interface types |
| `{$NET.IF.IFTYPE.NOT_MATCHES}` | `CHANGE_IF_NEEDED` | Excludes matching interface types |

## Known limitations

- The template has been validated on the model and software listed above.
  Private MIB availability and returned values may differ on other IE1000
  models or releases.
- Interface traffic uses 32-bit IF-MIB counters exposed by the tested device.
